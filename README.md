# Implementation of OTSNet using PyTorch Deep Learning Framework
 
The architecture was inspired by Effective encoder-decoder neural network for segmentation of orbital tissue in computed tomography images of Graves’ orbitopathy patients. 

## Overview
This repository contains an official implementation of OTSNet using PyTorch.<br/>
